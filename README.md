## How to test

1. Coach dashboard URL: https://stepful-scheduling.vercel.app/coaches/456
    * This page shows all the past and future meetings booked.

2. Coach Calendar and Availability URL: https://stepful-scheduling.vercel.app/coaches/456/calendar
    * This page shows a calendar where a coach can select a date, view any availability slots they've already added, as well as add new slots.

4. Student Dashboard URL: https://stepful-scheduling.vercel.app/students/123
    * This page shows the list of meetings booked for the student. It also allows the student to book other meetings.
